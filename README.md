## Architecture overview
This is a very simple project. An HTML file references the three images needed for the parallax: background, midground and foreground. It also includes a stylesheet and the main script.

The JavaScript file checks if it's being run inside Wallpaper Engine and, if so, edits the travel variables. It uses element.animate to move the images along. The project.json file includes configurations for the wallpaper settings.
